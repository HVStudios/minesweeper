Looking more into creating a grid playingfield via gloss, was very tricky but managed to create one but the code is very messy atm.

Made functions to draw cells and label the cells depending on what state they are in, unopenened, flagged etc, it seems to work however
right now none of the cells are in the dictionary so when you try to lookup a cell you get Nothing as answer, i need to add all the cells to the dictionary
but the code for drawing seems to work since i can change the text of when a cell is "nothing" to whatever and see that it draws it on every cell.
